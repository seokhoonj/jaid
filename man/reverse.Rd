\title{Reverse the order of elements in a vector (in place)}
\usage{
reverse(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector.}
}
\value{
The same vector \code{x}, modified in place, with its elements
in reverse order.
}
\description{
Reverses the order of elements directly in the input vector,
modifying it \strong{in place} rather than creating a copy.
This is memory-efficient for large vectors, but note that
the original object is altered.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# Reverse a numeric vector in place
x <- c(1:5)
reverse(x)
x  # now c(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
}
