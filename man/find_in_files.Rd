\title{Search files for lines containing a given pattern}
\usage{
find_in_files(
  path = getwd(),
  word,
  recursive = TRUE,
  ignore_case = TRUE,
  show_lines = TRUE,
  fixed = FALSE,
  skip_extensions
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character scalar. Path to a folder, file, or glob pattern.
Default is \code{getwd()}.}

\item{word}{Character scalar. Pattern to search for. If \code{fixed = TRUE}, the
pattern is matched literally, not as a regular expression.}

\item{recursive}{Logical. Whether to search subdirectories when \code{path} is a folder.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{ignore_case}{Logical. Whether to ignore case during matching. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{show_lines}{Logical. Whether to return and print matching line numbers
and text. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{fixed}{Logical. Whether to treat \code{word} as a fixed string rather than
a regular expression. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{skip_extensions}{Character vector. File extensions to skip during search
(e.g., binary files, images, compressed archives, PDFs). Default includes
common non-text formats such as \code{bin}, \code{dll}, \code{o}, \code{so}, \code{rda}, \code{rds},
images (\code{jpg}, \code{png}, etc.), compressed files (\code{zip}, \code{tar}, \code{gz}, etc.),
and \code{pdf}.}
}
\value{
A named list. Each element corresponds to one file, and is a data frame
with columns:
\describe{
\item{line}{Integer line numbers of matches}
\item{text}{Character strings of the matching lines}
}
}
\description{
Search within a folder, a single file, or a glob pattern (e.g. \verb{./R/*.R})
for lines that contain a given pattern. Results are returned as a named list,
where each element is a data frame with \code{line} and \code{text} columns.
In the console, matches are always highlighted in \strong{red + bold} using the
\code{\link{cli}} package.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item If \code{path} is a file, only that file is searched.
\item If \code{path} is a folder, all files are searched (recursively if \code{recursive = TRUE}).
\item If \code{path} contains a glob pattern (e.g. \code{"*.R"}), it is expanded via \code{\link[base:Sys.glob]{base::Sys.glob()}}.
\item Matches are shown in red and bold in the console.
\item If \code{show_lines = FALSE}, only filenames are shown (the returned data frames
will be empty).
