\title{Row- and column-wise differences}
\usage{
row_diff(x, na.rm = TRUE)

col_diff(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, missing values (\code{NA}/\code{NaN}) are not removed
in pairwise differences. Both elements of a pair must be non-missing to
yield a non-missing difference.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with one fewer row (\code{row_diff()}) or one fewer column
(\code{col_diff()}) than \code{x}, containing the differences between successive
elements along the specified dimension.
}
\description{
Compute successive differences within a numeric matrix, similar to
\code{\link[base:diff]{base::diff()}} but applied along rows or columns:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \code{row_diff()} computes differences between successive rows, column by column.
\item \code{col_diff()} computes differences between successive columns, row by row.
}
}
\examples{
\donttest{
x <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)

# Differences between successive rows
row_diff(x)

# Differences between successive columns
col_diff(x)
}

}
