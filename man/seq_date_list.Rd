\title{Generate sequences of Dates for each (from, to) range}
\usage{
seq_date_list(from, to, label = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{from}{A Date vector of start dates.}

\item{to}{A Date vector of end dates. Must be the same
length as \code{from}.}

\item{label}{Optional vector of labels (same length as \code{from}).}
}
\value{
A list of \code{Date} vectors, each element representing
a full daily sequence between corresponding \code{from} and \code{to}.
}
\description{
Expands paired start (\code{from}) and end (\code{to}) dates into full
daily sequences. Each element of the output corresponds to
one row of input, and contains a sequence of \code{Date} values
from \code{from[i]} to \code{to[i]} (inclusive).
}
\details{
Optionally, a \code{label} vector can be provided to tag each
sequence in the output.
\itemize{
\item Both \code{from} and \code{to} must be of class \code{Date}.
\item Sequences are inclusive of both endpoints.
\item If \code{label} is supplied, it is attached to the resulting list
as element names.
}
}
\examples{
from <- as.Date(c("2024-01-01", "2024-02-01"))
to   <- as.Date(c("2024-01-03", "2024-02-02"))

# Expand to daily sequences
seq_date_list(from, to)

# With labels
seq_date_list(from, to, label = c("A", "B"))
