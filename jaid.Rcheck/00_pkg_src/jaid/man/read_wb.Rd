\arguments{
\item{xlsxFile}{An xlsx file, Workbook object or URL to xlsx file.}

\item{sheet}{The name or index of the sheet to read data from.}

\item{startRow}{first row to begin looking for data.  Empty rows at the top of a file are always skipped,
regardless of the value of startRow.}

\item{colNames}{If \code{TRUE}, the first row of data will be used as column names.}

\item{rowNames}{If \code{TRUE}, first column of data will be used as row names.}

\item{detectDates}{If \code{TRUE}, attempt to recognise dates and perform conversion.}

\item{skipEmptyRows}{If \code{TRUE}, empty rows are skipped else empty rows after the first row containing data
will return a row of NAs.}

\item{skipEmptyCols}{If \code{TRUE}, empty columns are skipped.}

\item{rows}{A numeric vector specifying which rows in the Excel file to read.
If NULL, all rows are read.}

\item{cols}{A numeric vector specifying which columns in the Excel file to read.
If NULL, all columns are read.}

\item{check.names}{logical. If TRUE then the names of the variables in the data frame
are checked to ensure that they are syntactically valid variable names}

\item{sep.names}{One character which substitutes blanks in column names. By default, "."}

\item{namedRegion}{A named region in the Workbook. If not NULL startRow, rows and cols parameters are ignored.}

\item{na.strings}{A character vector of strings which are to be interpreted as NA. Blank cells will be returned as NA.}

\item{fillMergedCells}{If TRUE, the value in a merged cell is given to all cells within the merge.}

a data.table

\description{
read_wb is almost same as \code{\link[openxlsx:readWorkbook]{openxlsx::readWorkbook()}} but it's convenient when not knowing the
sheet names. and the output type is a data.table not a tibble.
